# :camera: Visual Quality Assessment Project

We are a young research team from [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](ntu.edu.sg) and [Sensetime Research](sensetime.com), aiming to build efficient and explainable Image and Video Quality Assessment approaches as well as exploring the perceptual mechanisms behind the human quality perception.
